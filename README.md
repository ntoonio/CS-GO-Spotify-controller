# CS:GO Spotify controller

A program that pauses your Spotify music when you're alive in a round. But plays it when you're dead or in a freezetime

## Get up and running

- Create an OAuth2 app on [](https://developers.spotify.com). Put the secret and id `Keys.py`.
- Change the ip in `gamestate_integration_music.cfg` to your ip.
- Put `gamestate_integration_music.cfg` in your `cfg` (usally `/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg`) folder. Restart the game if it was running.
- Start the script `App.py` and you should be good to go!
